            Our prophetic action focused on bringing the sights and experiences of poverty to a normal
            day at Bellarmine. We carried our belongings in trash bags, and spoke of the injustices
            of mass economic injustice. The prophetic nature of our action rests in its symbolic 
            nature, as our highlighting of the disparities of modern society mirrors the indictments
            of the prophets of old. Overall, our experience was a time of solidarity and education
            regarding our society's growing injustice.

            <h2> Reflection - Andrew </h2>
            <p>
                For our prophetic action, our group placed our school materials that we normally carry around in our backpacks into trash bags. In addition to carrying around school materials, we also placed additional items within the bags. Those additional items consisted of belongings a homeless person would have to carry around with them whenever moving to different locations. For example, some people carried an additional set of clothes, I personally included a sleeping bag. We carried around these bags throughout the school day and to classes. I thought that carrying around these trash bags was an interesting and different experience. Throughout the day many people looked at me weird, probably wondering why this kid was carrying around a trash bag instead of a backpack. I did not feel comfortable carrying around these bags as I was scared of being judged by other people. However, these are just some problems that homeless people must deal with constantly. While in public, they often receive many stares or people judge them on a daily basis. The action helped me realize not only the physical hardships but also social struggles that homeless must go through. I also hope that it helped others realize that homelessness is closer than they think, and that rather than looking away from those that are suffering, they instead open up and ask what they can do or help.

            <h2> Reflection - Max </h2>
            <p>
                While I was carrying around all my stuff in the trash bag, I felt both a metaphorical and real weight come over me, allowing me to feel the weight of responsibilities that hang over the impoverished. When the bag started falling apart the more and more I walked around for a day, I realized, as most of the items I placed within the bag, that not only those within poverty have to make sacrifices in things they need to help them survive, but they have to make those sacrifices every single day. It only hit me extremely hard when I realized what I was carrying maybe only a fraction of of the responsibilities that they carry with them every day, and I feel as though I understand the struggle to survive within poverty more through this experience.

            <img src="tonymax.jpg" style="width:667px;height:500px;">
            <p>
                While walking around carrying my things in a trash bag I realized just how difficult it was. Not just that it was heavy and uncomfortable to carry, but the looks that came from the people around. Whenever I saw someone look at me or my trash bag I was quick to say that it was for a school project. Most of the time they would just nod their heads in understanding, but a few would still look at me as if I was strange for walking around like this. What I learned from this experience is that people who actually live in these conditions do not just face the physical difficulties, but the psychological difficulties. The feeling of being different and odd dwells deep in their minds. I remember my papa telling me of a homeless man who walked around with a broken camera so he could pretend to be a tourist. He was not doing it for any reason, but to appear s the average citizen. In order to help these people they cannot only be given physical help, but they must be treated with human dignity as well.

              <h2> Reflection - Matthew </h2>
              <p> 
                  While carrying my bag to be in solidarity with the poor, I caught a small glimpse of how they live in their everyday lives. Through performing just a small part of this grueling task I was able to understand how hard it is to carry everything you have with you and how hard it is to pack up and move often. It shows that you don't really have to fit in anywhere and even if you seek help from others, most people will just pass you by. Over the course of the day, all but one close friend of mine, who is just as involved with solidarity, passed me by looking, but not saying a word. It was hard to carry the bag and I often had to stop to take a break, it was such a relief to know that someone would help me, but when he left, I realized that even the help you receive is short term, no one can stay and help forever. This thought puzzled me though because of all the homeless I have met, many are smiling and have hope that things will get better. This day long journey has inspired me to understand those who are homeless more, and to offer a helping hand as often as possible, but my journey was only a small pat of the lives that these people live.

            <h2> Reflection - Peter</h2>
            <p>
                Usually, actions in religion follow the same pattern. We do it, all write about how it "changed our perspective,"
                and go about our merry ways. However, this prophetic action broke that patten. Instead of being overly didactic, 
                our prophetic action was silently symbolic. I didn't walk around teaching about the injustice of the economic system, 
                but rather demonstrated it through our trash bag of stuff. I of course engaged the various teachers and other students
                who, with quizzical looks, asked me about my action. But most of all, what stuck with me was the simaltaneous normalcy
                and stridency of the action. We called out the system of overly didactic Justice Summits by engaging students in their
                normal lifes. That bringing of religion to people's normal lives is at the heart of prophetic action, and I learned
                that in ours.
