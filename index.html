            Today, let's take a look at the economic implications of the policies of a few presidential candidates.
            We present the ideas of candidates relative to four core issues of minimum wage, regulations, taxes, and trade.

        <p>
        Ted Cruz's plans focus on lowering taxes for all and removing regulations. The act of lowering taxes fits into Catholic Social Teaching because it reduces the burden on all, however,
        if such a tax cut comes at the cost of a more divisive society, it won't fit in. Every policy must be evaluated through
        the lens of how it affects the composition of society, and the flat tax and other measures can be seen as unduly punishing to the poor.

        <p>
            Hillary Clinton's policies focus on a more active government helping people. However, those programs come at the cost of higher taxes
            and other punitive actions against the rich. Again, the mindset of CST remains more important than any individual candidate.

        <h2> <img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/delegate-tracker/republican/img/candidates/donald-trump-gray.jpg?c=15928752" alt ="Donald" style="width:50px;height:50px;">Donald Trump </h2>

        <p>
            Note: We did not have the usual regulations section because we were unable to find any video of Trump explicating his regulatory policy.
            Trump's policies in regards to immigrants have recently drawn the ire of the Pope, but his economic policy rarely clashes with faith.
            The only thing to consider is the morality of retiributive trade deals, in which the sole role of the United States is to exploit other countries.

        <p>
            Again, complex policy analysis may demonstrate one thing or another, but an interesting point brought up in our breakout session is the morality
            of Sanders's divisive rhetoric. The demonizing of the rich as devils in the economy does not create the united society the Catholic Church aspires towards.
